##How did idea start##
Some times it's really understand the transmision line concepts when the student don't have a simulation tools to see what's happen through the line when the signal is transmitting. For that, I decided to create a little tool on MATLAB that show the behavoir of the line in terms of voltage, current, coefficient reflection, standing wave and other parameters of the line.
